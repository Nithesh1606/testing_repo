GIT
1.	How to install GitHub in the command line interface:=
            Type a command:-  yum install git.
 
==================================================================================
2.	Before installing the GitHub, we type the command git, so the result is shown in the command line interface (the command not found)
 

=============================================================================
3.	Next how to make versioning a particular folder:-

Step 1:- Create a folder mkdir <foldername>  (ex:- mkdir devops)
 

Step 2:- After creating a folder, get inside the folder cd  <foldername> (ex:- cd devops)
 

Step 3:- how to check the hidden file in the folder 
	ls -a
 

step 4:-
 now we will make this folder a git repository, because if we check the git status it will give us a message that it is (not a git repository).  That’s why we converted the folder into a Git repository.

How to do that:-

1st enter the command git init.
 

2nd  create a Empty file inside the devops folder touch simple.txt.
 

3rd again check the git status.
 

The above picture tells us that the simple.txt file is an untracked file, and provides instructions for converting it into a tracked file.


NOTE: Before converting into a tracked condition, you need to set up your Git identity, which means it is essential for tracking who made specific changes in a Git repository.

How to set up the git identity is:
 Enter the command git config –global user.email “ your@gmail.com”
					&
Enter the command git config –global user.name “yourname”.

 

Step 4th : Now before committing the file you need to add the file in the staging area (” staging area meaning it's now ready to be saved (committed)”)  

In simpler terms to understand the git add <filename > is:
•	Before using Git add: Git doesn’t know which changes you want to save.
•	After using git add: Git knows you want to save the changes to that file.
Now enter the command git add Simple.txt.
